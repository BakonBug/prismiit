## Prism

Prism is Illinois Tech's LGBTQ+ club on campus. The purpose of Prism at IIT is to create a community on campus for all students, faculty, and staff within the LGBTQIA+ community and offer support for those who are questioning their sexual and/or gender identities. Through dialogues, fellowship, and social activities, our objective is to raise awareness about the important issues the LGBTQIA+ community faces and foster an accepting campus environment.  

### GBM
