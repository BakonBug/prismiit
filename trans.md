## Guides

### Student Health and Wellness Center (SHWC)

The [SHWC](https://web.iit.edu/shwc) is not equipped to give prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However,  some steps in the transition process may require referral letters from a therapist, which can be provided through the free therapy services in the SHWC. 

### Healthcare & Insurance

Healthcare centers in Chicago that provide transitional care include [Howard Brown Health](https://howardbrown.org/) and the [Chicago Women's Health Center](http://www.chicagowomenshealthcenter.org/).

Coverage for HRT and surgery varies by insurance provider; check your plan details or call your provider for a more specific guide to coverage.

If you are using IIT's Aetna Student Health Plan,  prescription drugs are covered.  More detailed information about the student health plan coverage can be found by calling Aetna at 800-841-3140 .

### Name/Gender Change

If you are looking to legally change your name in Illinois, [Illinois Legal Aid Online](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/changing-your-name-0) has a detailed step by step guide through the process.

If you have legally corrected your name and/or gender, you're able to update that information at IIT as well, using the [Personal Information Change Request](https://my105.iit.edu/registrar/forms/view.php?id=19810) form.

To change your name on official administrative documentation, such as transcripts and ID cards, a legal name change is currently required. However, display names on certain school sites can be changed without legal action.

- In MyIIT, under "Training and Support," you can set up an alias (referred to as a nickname) through "Google Apps Account Maintenance" to change the name associated with your IIT email address. 
	 - Additionally, in Gmail under "Send mail as:" in the "Accounts" tab in settings, you can edit the name shown when you send emails with your hawk email.
- To change your display name in HawkLink, email [campus.life@iit.edu](mailto:campus.life@iit.edu).

### Bathrooms

As of Spring 2018, all single-user bathrooms are now labelled as gender neutral, as well as accessible (if applicable). Prism is currently working with administration towards approval for multi-stall gender neutral bathrooms with appropriate labeling. A map of the campus bathrooms labelled by gender can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ie=UTF8&t=h&oe=UTF8&msa=0&dg=feature&mid=1U_B5WGqN6rvYh5-lR0fqcoQE76w&ll=41.834995111681735%2C-87.62732700000004&z=16), not including a gender neutral, individual locker room in Keating Sports Center, located to the left of the main entrance.

### Housing
- When submitting a housing contract, you can specially request a co-ed floor regardless of legal gender, allowing you to use your preferred communal bathrooms.
- Additionally, you can choose a specific  (i.e. not randomly selected) roommate of the opposite legal gender with a special request. These requests can be made in the special accommodations section of the housing contract. For more information, email housing@iit.edu or visit the RGL office located in suite 110 of MSV. 

### General Advice

- To prevent misgendering & deadnaming by professors, send a copy-and-paste email (such as [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1GYXGXya3EpEMBMMfI1OsprSPICwErWjddW_aIPTHySU/edit?usp=sharing)) explaining that you use a different name and pronouns than those listed by the school at the beginning of the semester. Many professors will gladly change the class roster to list your preferred name.

### Support Groups

- The trans@iit group meets regularly for study and hangout sessions. These are open to all transgender and questioning individuals. Email [trans.at.iit@gmail.com](mailto:trans.at.iit@gmail.com) to find out when and where meetings are happening.
